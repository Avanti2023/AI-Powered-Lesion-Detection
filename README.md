# 🧠 AI-Powered Dermatological Lesion Detection
An AI-driven web application for real-time classification and early detection of 8 common skin conditions using computer vision and deep learning.

🚀 Overview
This project leverages MobileNetV2, TensorFlow, and Keras to build a lightweight and highly accurate image classification model that identifies dermatological diseases from user-uploaded images. The goal is to provide an accessible diagnostic aid for early skin disease detection and awareness.

💡 Key Features
🔬 Deep Learning-Based Classifier
Trained on dermatological image datasets to detect:

Cellulitis

Impetigo

Athlete’s Foot

Nail Fungus

Ringworm

Cutaneous Larva Migrans

Chickenpox

Shingles

# 🌐 User-Friendly Interface
Built with Streamlit, allowing users to:

Upload images and receive instant AI predictions

View confidence scores for each condition

Access suggested treatments and symptom summaries

Download prediction results in CSV format for tracking history

📊 Interactive Visualizations
Includes confidence bar charts to help users understand the model's decision-making.

# 🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: Python, TensorFlow, Keras

Model: MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
