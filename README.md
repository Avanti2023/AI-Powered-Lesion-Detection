# üß† AI-Powered Dermatological Lesion Detection
An AI-driven web application for real-time classification and early detection of 8 common skin conditions using computer vision and deep learning.

### üöÄ Overview
This project leverages MobileNetV2, TensorFlow, and Keras to build a lightweight and highly accurate image classification model that identifies dermatological diseases from user-uploaded images. The goal is to provide an accessible diagnostic aid for early skin disease detection and awareness.

### üí° Key Features 
It is a Deep Learning-Based Classifier,trained on dermatological image datasets to detect below mentioned diseases

## ü©∫ Skin Diseases Detected

1. **Cellulitis**
2. **Impetigo**
3. **Athlete‚Äôs Foot**
4. **Nail Fungus**
5. **Ringworm**
6. **Cutaneous Larva Migrans**
7. **Chickenpox**
8. **Shingles**

## üåê Intuitive AI-Powered Interface

Built using **Streamlit** to provide a user-friendly experience:

- Upload skin images and get real-time AI predictions  
- View confidence scores for each detected condition  
- Access treatment suggestions and brief symptom summaries  
- Download prediction results as CSV for easy tracking and history management
